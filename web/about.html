  <p><i>What If?</i> is a party game where players answer multiple-choice
  hypothetical questions about the other players.  The object is to pick the
  answer that received the most votes.  It works best with players that know
  each other, and can work with either a local (in-person) group, or with a
  group phone or video chat.</p>

  <p>While it's possible to play with just two players (or alone, if you
  like answering questions about yourself), the scoring system is designed
  for at least three players, and the game is best with a larger group.</p>

  <p>Each player logs in with their name (nicknames are fine, but remember
  that everyone needs to recognize who you are) and a room code, which can
  be any word or phrase that the group selected.  All players who enter the
  same room code will be playing together.</p>

  <p>Once all players have joined, one player should press the “Start game”
  button to begin the game.  That player becomes the host and is responsible
  for determining when to move from one question to the next.  Players may
  join or leave the game at any time.</p>

  <p>For each round, a hypothetical question is shown, such as “If JAMES
  were a flavor of ice cream, which would he be?”  All players are presented
  with a multiple-choice list of responses, and should choose whichever one
  they feel fits the question best.</p>

  <p>After all players have chosen an answer, the players that chose the
  <em>most popular</em> answer are awarded 1,000 points.  If multiple
  answers tied for being the most popular, then that award is reduced.
  In addition, the player who the question was about will be penalized 500
  points if they choose the wrong answer.</p>

  <p>The game is similar to <i>iMAgiNiff</i> by Buffalo Games, which from
  what I can tell has been out of production for at least several years.</p>
